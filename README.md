# T-SFuzzyController-Design-for-Nonlinearsystems-using-LMI-byHan

This repository provides the code about the T-S fuzzy controller design with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).<br>
The example system is considered as a complicated nonlinear system.<br>
This system is linearized into 12 subsystems.

## Simulation Guide
Please run the code based on the following steps.

Step 1. Find feasible controller gains by running the code "ND_TSfuzzy_rule12.ipynb (ND: Nonlinear Dynamics)." <br>
Step 2. Run the MATLAB code "Simulation_ND_rule12.m."<br>
Step 3. Please refer the uploaded paper [1] to understand the addressed T-S fuzzy system.
