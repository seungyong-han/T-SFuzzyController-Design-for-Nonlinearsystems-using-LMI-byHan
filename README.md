# T-SFuzzyController-Design-for-Nonlinearsystems-using-LMI-byHan

This repository provides the code about the T-S fuzzy controller design with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
The example system is considered as a complicated nonlinear system.
This system is linearized into 12 sub systems.

## Simulation Guide
Please run the code based on the following steps.

Step 1. Find feasible controller gains in Python by running the code "ND_TSfuzzy_rule12." <br>
Step 2. Run the MATLAB code "Simulation_ND."
Step 3. Please refer the uploaded paper [1] to understand the T-S fuzzy system.
